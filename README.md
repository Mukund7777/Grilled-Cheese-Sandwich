Grilled Cheese Sandwich

My recipe is about a sandwich full of cheese with some vegetables, mashed potato and corn. It is made on a griller to make it taste even tastier and crispier. As you know its all about taste and style as well. So I used an evenly sized plate to keep the sandwich along with its green chutney which is cooked in the traditional way. This is what my recipe is about.
